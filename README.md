# programmingLanguages
Assortment of projects written in various languages

# C
p1 - Stack implementation
-  Focus: Get familiarized with programming in C

p2 - Matrix multiplication
- reads in two matrices from input text file, multiplies and prints result
- Focus: explicit allocation and addressing of arrays and 2d arrays

# Fortran95
p3 - Travelling Salesman Problem
-  reads in table of cities and the distances between each city
-  brute force algorithm calculates the total distance to visit every city
   for every possible permutation, outputs most efficient permutation
-  Focus: Understanding design choices in modern programming languages by 
   by getting familiarized with a more obsolete language i.e. Fortran

# C++
p4 - Operator overloading
-  overloaded the pre (++x) and post-increment (x++) operators for the
   created Counter class
-  Focus: Rudimentary experience overloading operators in C++

p5 - Fraction operator overloading
-  overload operators for the created Fraction class to allow the use of
   the assignment, relational, arithmetic, and stream operators
   
# Scheme
p6 - Recursive list operations
-  implemented the reverse, even reverse, penultimate, palindrome, and
   change head functions
-  Focus: Understading list manipulation with functional programming
